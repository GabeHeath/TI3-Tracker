Turn tracker todo:

Fix slide indicators when Naalu slide present

Rework 3-4 players so the order goes from the lowest SC and loops. Trim to 3 or 4 slides with information for both SC's chosen.

find a better way to hide arrows if only one slide left. If bonuses remove a slide then it doens't work. I think. Maybe if you click pass on last slide it will.

create restore slides function for new round.

fix bugs for when people move stuff around in tracker after the round has started.
	new bonus not black
	slides mixed up
	titles not black


Keep position value saved so it can be resumed upon refresh.
After all have passed end round and increment round counter.

Add Domain counter pictures and desriptions becuase can't put table in modal apparently (maybe because modal is being triggered within a table.
